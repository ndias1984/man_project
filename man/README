#First step
-> Run MAN_DDL.sql script (root of the project) in a MYSQL DB

#Second Step
-> Use build_and_run.bat to package and run the application
-> You can do that by clicking on the bat file, or go to the root of the project and execute the bat from there.

#Docker Step that didn't work (USE SECOND STEP)
-> 
docker build -t man .
docker-compose up 

REASON: For some reason the docker-compose file is not working locally, since it gets errors 
when trying to connect to MySQL in port 3306. Couldn't pass this problem in my local PC. The files are also available (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml)

#The SpringBoot application is now running, providing two GET APIs and Running a SpringBatch JOB in the background

#The application will create two folders in user.home location with the names to_be_processed and processed
-> Manualy put one hard_* file, one soft_* file or both in to_be_processed folder

#Check in the log the job processing all data on those files

-> Those files will be moved to the processed folder with the name YYYYMMSSHHMMSS_hardware_file.csv or YYYYMMSSHHMMSS_software_file.csv
-> Add two more files or one (soft or hard) to folder to_be_processed

Test the APIs:
Open a Postman and create a GET request with http://localhost:8080/fota/vehicles/3C3CFFER4ET929645/incompatible for example
Open a Postamn and create a GET request with http://localhost:8080/fota/vehicles/3C3CFFER4ET929645/installable for example
